# N-body-html
The N-body problem is a classical problem in physics and celestial mechanics that involves predicting the individual motions of a group of celestial bodies (such as stars, planets, or galaxies) interacting with each other gravitationally.

The N-body problem has no general closed-form analytical solution for N ≥ 3, meaning we cannot write down a simple equation that predicts the exact motions of all bodies indefinitely. However, depending on the context, we can find approximate, numerical, or special-case solutions.

A few exact solutions exist under strict conditions:

**Euler’s collinear solutions (1767):** Three bodies move in a straight line.

**Lagrange’s equilateral solutions (1772):** Three bodies form a rotating equilateral triangle (e.g., Trojan asteroids).

**Figure-8 orbit (1990s):** Three equal masses follow a stable figure-8 path (discovered numerically).

**Periodic orbits:** Infinitely many unstable periodic solutions exist, but they require fine-tuned initial conditions.
